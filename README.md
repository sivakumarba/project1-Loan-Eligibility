# project1-Loan-Eligibility

Problem Statement :

                 *  The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process based on customer detail provided while filling out online            application forms.     
   Identify Which Type of Problem:

         * This is a classification problem in which we need to classify whether the loan will be eligible or not. classification refers to     a predictive modeling problem where a class label is predicted for a given example of input data.  

    How to Approach the Problem: 

               * This is a Binary Classification problem in which we need to predict our Target label which is “Loan Status”.

                      Loan status can have two values: Yes or NO.

                 *   Yes: if the loan is eligible

                 *   NO: if the loan is not eligible

       So using the training dataset we will train our model and try to predict our target column that is “Loan Status” on the test          dataset.
